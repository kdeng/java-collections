# Multiple Module Application Practice

This is a multiple module web application based on serval tehcnologoies, such as Spring MVC, Syllabus, Spring Boot and so on.

# Module List
1. Ebean Domain: a simple domain module based on Ebean ORM
2. Hibernate Domain: a simple domain module based on Hibernate 5


# Technical Stacks
- Servlet 3 (Web Fragment)
- Spring MVC
- Syllabus (Restful)
- Stencil (Single Page App)
- Ebean (ORM)
- Hibernate (ORM)
- Spring Boot (Package)
- AngularJS (webjar)
- BootStrap (webjar)

# Note
This practice is NOT a good development example, but I just want to find a way to sort out how to build a web applicaton by mix multiple technologies together.
