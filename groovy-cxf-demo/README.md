This is a sample for myself to use Apache CXF, Spring framework and Spring Boot.




To try out:
---
1. Check out the project from github
2. Install JDK 1.8+ (Java 8, prefer Oracle JDK)
3. Install Maven 3.2.1+
4. Set JAVA_HOME to the installed JDK 1.8
5. Go to the project directory, and issue _mvn clean spring-boot:run_
6. Open a browser and navigate to _http://localhost:8080/ws/personService?wsdl_
